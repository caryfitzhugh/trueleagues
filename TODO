change  user to have 'pending'
need to have a 'merge user' command, to let you combine users into one account.


* to add a team to a league , click add team.
* it asks for a team name (if possible) and an email of the team manager(s).




* those users are looked up, and a second page says 'create new account' or use these accounts'
* then an email is sent to sign them up / tell them of the link to the team page (and they can then add users , etc)


* To add to the league -- you get a link to the league page, and press 'join league'
* It opens up a window, you can 'create a new team', or pick one of your existing teams.
 ???
* then that is 'pending' state...
* to be approved by the league manager.
